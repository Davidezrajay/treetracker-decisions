# Greenstand Engineering Blog

* Status: proposed 

* Deciders: @Davidezrajay @ZavenArra @dadiorchen @gwynndp @nmcharlton @sebastiangaertner @Elforama 

* Date: 2022-12-20 



## Context and Problem Statement

Complex problems are being solved week in week out by Greenstand Engineers volunteers with no trace of any documentation, thus leaving the next batch of volunteers with no point of reference when it comes time to work on projects. Furthermore, the engineering community can't benefit from the solutions to these problems they may also encounter.

## Decision Drivers 

* A blogging platform which is popular among the engineering community
* Having a free tier


## Considered Options

Some of the blogging platforms we can leverage are:
* Medium
* Dev
* Greenstand own blog 
* Beamstart
* Telegra.ph


## Decision Outcome

* Medium, because it is the most popular blogging platform in the engineering community
* A case could be made of leveraging Greenstand's own blog 


### Positive Consequences 

* Greenstand Engineering blog will showcase the brilliance of the engineering team
* Put the limelight on the extraordinary work been done in the organization
* Persuade new volunteers to join this great team of engineers
* Serve as documentation for future reference


### Negative Consequences 

* Added cost of the blogging platform


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Medium

The blog will be available to a wide audience worldwide since the platform is being visited by 60 million readers per month

* Good, because of the worldwide audience
* Good, because its free
* Bad, because we don't own the space 



### Dev

It is a well known household name in the development community having a positive and welcoming environment

* Good, because having a growing audience monthly
* Good, because it's free
* Bad, because you can't customize your domain


### Greenstand existing blog

Leveraging Greensand existing blog

* Good, because it is a space owned by greenstand
* Good, because no need for further incurred cost
* Bad, because not having the same exposure as the other platforms


### Beamstart

Leveraging Greensand's existing blog

* Good, because it aggregates content from various publishers around the world
* Good, because its free
* Bad, because its not a community driven platform


### Telegra.ph

It's a blogging platform created by Telegram. It's very minimalistic tool where you can just go and start writing without any further steps

* Good, because it's easy to use and publishes instantly
* Good, because it's free
* Bad, because it's not as popular as the other options
